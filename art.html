    <p class="jj"><b>Antoine Blanchard</b></p>
    <p class="kk">(1910-1988) Like his contemporary, Édouard Cortès, he devoted his artistic career to the depiction of
        Paris
        through all its daily and seasonal changes. But he was not an imitator of Cortes, but rather depicted the life
        of Paris at the turn of the century from his own point of view. <b><u>View Artwork</u></b></p>

    <p class="tete"><b>Carl Brenders</b></p>
    <p class="ete">The wildlife images of Brenders' art are first created from pencil sketches; from these sketches his
        mixed media
        paintings of watercolor and gouache are completed with a technique he has developed during the last 25 years.
        His paintings, encompassing every intricacy of nature, devote equal attention to the detail of the wildlife
        subject and its habitat as well as to the mood created by the light.<b><u>View Artwork</u></b></p>
